This repo contains all of my (public) extracirricular work invovling python. \
I also dabble with online coding trainers; checkout my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/alfi_ingi).

* "EngageThrusters" contains a simple pixel-art video-game implementation using the pygame module.
* "Algorithms" contains code that I developed while studying algorithm design and anlysis.
