# Python Experiments
This repo contains all of my (public) extracirricular work invovling python. For notes that contain code that I did not write myself, I acknowledge the author(s) and reference the source. Alongside these experiments, I also dabble with online coding trainers; checkout my [HackerRank profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/alfi_ingi)!
